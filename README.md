# Flight Booking Predictor

## Overview
Flight Booking Predictor is an innovative project designed to analyze and predict flight booking patterns using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging data from various sources and applying predictive modeling algorithms, this project aims to provide valuable insights into customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies for British airlines.

## Motivation
In today's highly competitive airline industry, understanding customer preferences and predicting booking patterns are essential for maximizing revenue and enhancing customer satisfaction. By accurately predicting flight bookings, airlines can optimize pricing strategies, tailor marketing campaigns, and improve overall operational efficiency.

## Features
- **Web Scraping:** Utilized web scraping techniques to collect reviews and sentiment analysis data from various online platforms, providing valuable insights into customer satisfaction and sentiment towards the flight experiences.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Processed and prepared the collected data for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature engineering to extract valuable insights.
- **Model Training:** Trained machine learning models, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, to predict flight bookings based on the prepared dataset. Used techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the performance of trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Conducted comprehensive analysis to interpret the results and identify key factors influencing flight bookings.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Analyzed the importance of features in predicting flight bookings using techniques such as permutation importance and mutual information scores. Identified critical features that significantly impact booking decisions.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 85.15% with the Random Forest model and 72.00% with the Gradient Boosting model.
- Identified key features influencing flight bookings, including purchase lead time, sales channel, and customer preferences.
- Provided valuable insights into customer behavior and booking patterns, enabling airlines to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Future Directions
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and ensemble methods, to further improve predictive performance.
- Incorporate additional data sources, such as customer demographics and historical booking data, to enhance the predictive model's accuracy and robustness.
- Deploy the predictive model as a service for real-time flight booking prediction, enabling airlines to make data-driven decisions and maximize revenue.
